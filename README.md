# Daysattendence
This programs tell how many days a student has to attend to meet the attendance criteria.
<br>
For example:- If John's had attended 100 days out of 200 days of his college, And his college demands that he must have 75% or more attendence atleast.
So this program will show how many more days will john have to attend to have 75% attendence.
<br>
This program takes input in one line example -> 100 200 75
and will output days example -> 200
<br>
The working is simple and it can be optimized further, currently it is using a simple while loop.
<br>
Explaniation of calculation :- if input is "100 200 75" the resutlt will be 200,
because 100 + 200 = 300 , 200 + 200 = 400
        300/400 * 100 = 75%
